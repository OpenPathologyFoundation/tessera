## 1. Purpose

This Design History File (DHF) documents the complete design and development lifecycle of the WBC ΔΣ application. It provides objective evidence that the device was developed in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and the organization's quality management system.

## 2. Product Description

WBC ΔΣ is a web-based clinical laboratory software tool that enables hematology laboratory personnel to perform manual differential white blood cell counts on bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood specimens. The tool uses keyboard input to tally cell types, automatically calculates percentages, and generates formatted output reports in institutional templates.

## 3. Intended Use Statement

WBC ΔΣ is intended to be used by trained clinical laboratory personnel (medical technologists, pathologists, and hematology fellows) as a counting and calculation aid during manual microscopic review of bone marrow aspirate and peripheral blood smears. The software tallies operator-entered cell classifications and computes differential percentages. **The software does not perform autonomous cell identification or classification.** All cell identification decisions are made by the operator.

## 4. Indications for Use

- Manual differential cell counting on bone marrow aspirate smears
- Manual differential cell counting on peripheral blood smears
- Calculation of differential percentages
- Generation of formatted count reports for clinical documentation
