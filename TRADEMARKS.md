# Tessera Trademark and Branding Policy

“Tessera” is the project name. The Tessera name and the Tessera logo (`assets/card.png`) are used to identify the official project maintained by the project owner(s).

The software source code in this repository is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 (see `LICENSE`). **Trademark rights and branding assets are not granted under the Apache-2.0 license.**

## Allowed (no permission needed)

You may, without prior permission:

- Refer to the project by name (“Tessera”) when describing your use of this software.
- Link to the official repository.
- State that your software is “based on” or “derived from” Tessera, provided you do not imply endorsement.
- Use the word “Tessera” in documentation to accurately describe compatibility or origin (nominative use).

## Not Allowed (permission required)

You may not, without prior written permission:

- Use the Tessera logo (`assets/card.png`) or other branding assets to brand or market your fork, product, or service.
- Name a fork, modified version, or competing product/service “Tessera” (or a confusingly similar name) in a way that could imply it is the official project.
- Use “Tessera” or the logo in marketing, product names, or domain names in a way that suggests endorsement, affiliation, or official status.

## Requests

If you want to use the Tessera name or logo beyond the Allowed section (e.g., for a hosted service, commercial distribution, or partnership branding), contact the project owner(s) to request permission.

This is the standard OSS pattern: Apache for code, controlled marks for branding.
