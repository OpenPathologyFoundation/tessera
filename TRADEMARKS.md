# WBC ΔΣ Trademark and Branding Policy

"WBC ΔΣ" is the project name. The WBC ΔΣ name and the WBC ΔΣ logo are used to identify the official project maintained by the project owner(s).

The software source code in this repository is licensed under the Apache License 2.0 (see `LICENSE`). **Trademark rights and branding assets are not granted under the Apache-2.0 license.**

## Allowed (no permission needed)

You may, without prior permission:

- Link to the official repository.
- State that your software is "based on" or "derived from" WBC ΔΣ, provided you do not imply endorsement.
- Use the name "WBC ΔΣ" in documentation to accurately describe compatibility or origin (nominative use).

## Not Allowed (permission required)

You may not, without prior written permission:

- Use the WBC ΔΣ logo or other branding assets to brand or market your fork, product, or service.
- Name a fork, modified version, or competing product/service "WBC ΔΣ" (or a confusingly similar name) in a way that could imply it is the official project.
- Use "WBC ΔΣ" or the logo in marketing, product names, or domain names in a way that suggests endorsement, affiliation, or official status.

## Requests

If you want to use the WBC ΔΣ name or logo beyond the Allowed section (e.g., for a hosted service, commercial distribution, or partnership branding), contact the project owner(s) to request permission.

This is the standard OSS pattern: Apache for code, controlled marks for branding.
