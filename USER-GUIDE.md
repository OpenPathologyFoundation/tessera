## Tips

- **Undo a miscount** — hold `Shift` + the key you want to correct (decrements by 1).
- **Morphology comments** — expand the comments field during counting to note findings (500 char limit). Typing in the field won't trigger counts.
- **Theme toggle** — press `Ctrl+Shift+L` (or `Cmd+Shift+L` on Mac) to switch between dark and light mode.
- **Session history** — completed counts are listed at the bottom of the page for the current browser session. Export to CSV or JSON for a local record.
- **Output templates** — after completing a count, switch between institutional output formats using the tabs (e.g., Yale SOM, MGH, Precipio DX).
